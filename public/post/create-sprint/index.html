      <p>A sprint is a set period of time during which your team will attempt to complete development work from a backlog. Sprints are a main component of the agile methodology of project management, called Scrum. Scrum focuses on the continuing delivery of features in bite-sized increments. To learn more, see <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module">What is Scrum?</a>.</p>
<p>Many organizations use <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> software to track the work they complete during sprints. This tutorial will walk you through the steps to create, populate, and complete sprints using Jira.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-project">Create a project</h2>
<p>A project within Jira is a container for tasks that represent an organization, project, or product. First, create a project to organize your tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <code>Projects</code> &gt; <code>Create Project</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the <code>Software Development</code> template, then choose the <code>Scrum</code> template, and click <code>Use Template</code> to confirm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a project type:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Team-managed</strong>: Allows you to control processes in a self-contained space.</li>
<li><strong>Company managed</strong>: Choose this project type to share tasks across teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a name for your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the access for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private</strong>: Only allows admins and added users to search, view and edit issues.</li>
<li><strong>Limited</strong>: Anyone in your organization can view and comment on the project.</li>
<li><strong>Open</strong>: Anyone in your organization can search, view and edit this project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <code>Create Project</code> to finalize.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: There are many project templates available to choose from. This tutorial demonstrates using Jira with a software development project.</em></p>
<h2 id="create-an-epic">Create an epic</h2>
<p>An epic is a collection of work focused on a larger goal. An example of an epic is a new feature your team is developing as part of a larger product release. Tasks within an epic are called stories.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the project dashboard, click <code>Backlog</code>. This is where you can view all the stories your team has created.</li>
<li>Click <code>+ Create Epic</code> to create a new collection of tasks. Enter a name for your epic.</li>
<li>Click on the epic to see more details on the right side of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/epic-menu-1.png" alt="epic menu"></p>
<h2 id="create-a-story">Create a story</h2>
<p>Stories are the small chunks of work that make up your epic. All your team&rsquo;s stories are collected within the backlog.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the <code>Epic</code> swimlane, click the epic that you want to assign your story to.</li>
<li>In the <code>Backlog</code> click <code>+ Create Issue</code>.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the story.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/story-new-1.png" alt="new story"></p>
<h3 id="manage-stories">Manage stories</h3>
<p>You can edit stories after you create them. For example, you can add and update a story&rsquo;s point estimation. Story points are a measure of the effort and time it will take your team to complete a task.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click a story to display details in the right-hand menu. To view a story in full screen, click the title of the story.</li>
<li>You can add more information to a story within this view.</li>
<li>Click <code>Story point estimate</code> to enter the story point value for the task.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-and-start-a-sprint">Create and start a sprint</h2>
<p>After you have created an epic and populated it with stories, it is time to start a new sprint. Starting a sprint locks in the stories you have chosen to the duration of the sprint. Try not to edit the sprint after you have started it, as a sprint is meant to capture both the work completed and work that isn&rsquo;t completed before the time period ends.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <code>Backlog</code>, click <code>Create Sprint</code>.</li>
<li>Click and drag stories from the <code>Backlog</code> section into the new sprint you have created.</li>
<li>When you are satisfied with the amount of work in the sprint, click the <code>Start Sprint</code> button.</li>
<li>Enter the following information for the sprint:
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> The length of your sprint. You can select a predetermined period of time or define one.</li>
<li><strong>Start date:</strong> The start date of the sprint.</li>
<li><strong>End date:</strong> The end date of the sprint.</li>
<li><strong>Sprint goal:</strong> The goal your team is trying to achieve during the sprint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <code>Start</code> button.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: You can only have one active sprint at a time, although you can create as many sprints as needed for future planning.</em></p>
<h2 id="manage-the-sprint">Manage the sprint</h2>
<p>Part of the usefulness of using sprints is being able to move stories through different statuses as your team progresses through their work. Everyone on your team can view a task&rsquo;s progress by looking at the backlog.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the left-hand menu, navigate to <code>Board</code>.</li>
<li>Click and drag tasks to the appropriate swimlane based on their status. For example, drag completed stories to the <code>Done</code> swimlane.</li>
</ul>
